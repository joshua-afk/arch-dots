# IMPORTANT

### On GPU upgrade
Change the `onnxruntime-cpu` in `arch/pkglist-aur-common.txt.tmpl` to specific
`onnxruntime` of the GPU. Refer here: [https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/onnxruntime/](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/onnxruntime/)
NOTE: The current `onnxruntime-cpu` is for iGPU (Integrated Graphics Processing Unit) of CPU.
